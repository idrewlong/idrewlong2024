                <p class="text-gray-500">After graduating from Pillow Academy in 2014, I continued my education at Mississippi Delta Community College. There, I held several leadership positions, earning a full academic scholarship to the University of Mississippi. While pursuing my broadcast journalism degree, I explored my creativity through photography, videography and video editing. Unfortunately, financial constraints led me to leave in August 2018. I delved into freelancing, taking on marketing and video production gigs while juggling multiple jobs. The gigs in video production led me to travel to Nashville, Atlanta, Houston and New Orleans for months at a time. <br><br> In May 2022, I returned to complete my degree, fueling my passion for learning and growth. In August 2023, a friend introduced me to programming, igniting a new passion that I've pursued ever since. During this period, I launched Finder's Guide, a marketing agency dedicated to assisting businesses in building and scaling their sales and marketing funnels. Our services encompass comprehensive solutions for enhancing their online presence, spanning from social media management to web development. Currently, I serve as a Marketing Coordinator at Thompson Machinery in Nashville, TN, where I handle tasks such as building landing pages, managing email campaigns, and overseeing media for various departments.<br><br> Outside of work, I dedicate myself to honing my skills in web development and programming. Eager to continue my journey, I'm excited about the prospect of joining a software development team to further enhance my skills and pursue my dream career.
